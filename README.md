# Project 1 - Business Statistics: E-news Express

## 📂 Project Overview

E-news Express, an online news portal, aims to expand its business by increasing new subscribers. The company has redesigned its landing page to improve user engagement and conducted an A/B test to evaluate its effectiveness. This project involves statistical analysis to determine whether the new landing page leads to higher user engagement and conversions.

## 📌 Objectives

The objective of this study is to analyze user behavior on the existing and new landing pages and answer the following questions:

&emsp;&emsp;Do users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?

&emsp;&emsp;Is the conversion rate for the new page greater than that of the old page?

&emsp;&emsp;Does the conversion status depend on the preferred language?

&emsp;&emsp;Is the time spent on the new page the same for different language users?

## 🛠️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains user interactions with the old and new versions of the landing page. The key attributes include:

&emsp;&emsp;user_id: Unique identifier for each visitor.

&emsp;&emsp;group: Indicates whether a user belongs to the control group (existing landing page) or the treatment group (new landing page).

&emsp;&emsp;landing_page: Specifies whether the user interacted with the old or new landing page.

&emsp;&emsp;time_spent_on_the_page: Duration (in minutes) a user spent on the landing page.

&emsp;&emsp;converted: Whether the user subscribed to the news portal.

&emsp;&emsp;language_preferred: Language chosen by the user to view the landing page.

## 📊 Methodology

The following steps were performed in the analysis:

&emsp;&emsp;Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset and cleaning if necessary.

&emsp;&emsp;Hypothesis Testing:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Comparing time spent on both pages.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Analyzing conversion rates across groups.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Evaluating the relationship between conversion rates and language preference.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Testing if time spent varies across languages.

&emsp;&emsp;Insights & Conclusions: Summarizing findings and recommending actions based on statistical results.
